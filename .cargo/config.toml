# Cargo configuration for forth-lsp workspace

[alias]
# Convenient alias to run tests for all workspace members
t = "test --workspace"

# Note: Due to Cargo's design, 'cargo test' without flags only tests
# the current package. Use 'cargo test --workspace' or 'cargo t' to test
# both forth-lsp and forth-lexer.
