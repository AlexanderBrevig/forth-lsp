( x a-addr -- )
Store x at a-addr. 

/num
#
( ud1 -- ud2 )
Divide ud1 by the number in BASE giving the quotient ud2 and the remainder n. (n is the least significant digit of ud1.) Convert n to external form and add the resulting character to the beginning of the pictured numeric output string. An ambiguous condition exists if # executes outside of a <# #> delimited number conversion. 

/num-end
#>
( xd -- c-addr u )
Drop xd. Make the pictured numeric output string available as a character string. c-addr and u specify the resulting character string. A program may replace characters within the string. 

/numS
#S
( ud1 -- ud2 )
Convert one digit of ud1 according to the rule for #. Continue conversion until the quotient is zero. ud2 is zero. An ambiguous condition exists if #S executes outside of a <# #> delimited number conversion.
